/* Generate a Lockin backup file for taking README screenshots.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. Screenshots need a populated app, and a real install either has thin
 * data or someone's actual gamertag and performance in it. This produces a plausible
 * mid-programme state you can import into a THROWAWAY profile, photograph, and discard.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It seeds no Leetify checkpoints and no dramatic
 * before/after. A screenshot is allowed to show what the app LOOKS LIKE; it is not allowed
 * to imply what the app DID FOR YOU. Lockin's whole position is that it doesn't claim
 * outcomes it can't evidence, and a staged "aim 62 -> 78" in a README would be exactly that
 * claim, made in the one format nobody reads sceptically.
 *
 * The numbers here are ordinary on purpose: a real streak with a real gap in it, hand feel
 * that wobbles, a dominant leak that is dominant but not cartoonish.
 *
 *   node scripts/make-demo-seed.js [outfile]     (default: demo-seed.json)
